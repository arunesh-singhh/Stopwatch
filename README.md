The project is a stopwatch web application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to create a functional stopwatch with features like start, stop, and reset buttons. Here's a brief overview:


HTML Structure:     
The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the web page. It includes a card container that holds the stopwatch elements.
Inside the card, there's a title "Stopwatch", a display area to show the time, and buttons for start, stop, and reset.
     
CSS Styling:     
The CSS file (styles.css) provides basic styling for the stopwatch and the card container.
The card has defined width, padding, border, border-radius, and a box-shadow to give it a card-like appearance.
The stopwatch elements are centered within the card, and the buttons have styling for size, margin, padding, colors, and hover effects.
    
JavaScript Functionality:     
The JavaScript file (script.js) handles the stopwatch functionality.
It uses DOM manipulation to select HTML elements and add event listeners to buttons.
Functions are created to start the timer, stop the timer, reset the timer, update the displayed time, and format the time properly (hours, minutes, seconds).
The setInterval() method is used to update the time display every second when the stopwatch is running, and clearInterval() stops the timer when needed.
    
Project Structure:    
The project follows the guidelines by not using any external libraries or frameworks for JavaScript.
It fulfills the requirements of creating a stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionalities.
The code is structured with comments for better readability and understanding.
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are separated to maintain clean code organization.
